# File_to_GitHub

This repository was homework from the ComIT course, where I should have a file on my computer and send it to GitHub. For it, I did the steps below:

1. Open my command line application (git bash).
2. Create a helloworld.py application (Nano)
3. Create my repository "File_to_GitHub" on github.com
4. Setup your helloworld.py app under source control, using the following commands: 
a) git init 
b) git status 
c) git remote add origin "https link" (from GitHub) 
d) git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories 
e) git add . 
f) fit commit -m "First change in the file" 
g) git push origin main

In this way I pushed my file up to my own repositorio.
